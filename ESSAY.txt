Q1:
    - A naive way of doing it would be to save different permutations of phrases up to a point, and treat those as terms as
    well. This would work, but would take up significantly more space.
    - Another way is to save the terms along with their relative position when indexing. When phrasal queries are done, each
    term's relative position value can be checked with the relative position value of the next term in the query, if not present,
    processing of the doc can stop right there, and move on to process the next doc.
    - This would save significant time, as the search would not have to go to completion for every term in the query, but only
    when the doc is promising.
